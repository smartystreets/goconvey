////////////////////////////////// suite //////////////////////////////////

// Convey is the method intended for use when declaring the scopes
// of a specification. Each scope has a description and a func()
// which may contain other calls to Convey(), Reset() or Should-style
// assertions. Convey calls can be nested as far as you see fit.
//
// IMPORTANT NOTE: The top-level Convey() within a Test method
// must conform to the following signature:
//
//     Convey(description string, t *testing.T, action func())
//
// All other calls should like like this (no need to pass in *testing.T):
//
//     Convey(description string, action func())
//
// Don't worry, the goconvey will panic if you get it wrong so you can fix it.
//
// All Convey()-blocks also take an optional parameter of FailureMode which
// sets how goconvey should treat failures for So()-assertions in the block and
// nested blocks. See the constants in this file for the available options.
//
// By default it will inherit from its parent block and the top-level blocks
// start with setting of FailureHalts.
//
// This parameter is inserted before the block itself:
//
//     Convey(description string, t *testing.T, mode FailureMode, action func())
//     Convey(description string, mode FailureMode, action func())
//
// See the examples package for, well, examples.
func Convey(items ...interface{}) {
	Conveyance(discover(items))

// SkipConvey is analagous to Convey except that the scope is not executed
// (which means that child scopes defined within this scope are not run either).
// The reporter will be notified that this step was skipped.
func SkipConvey(items ...interface{}) {
	entry := discover(items)
	entry.Func = nil
	Conveyance(entry)
}

// FocusConvey is has the inverse effect of SkipConvey. If the top-level
// Convey is changed to `FocusConvey`, only nested scopes that are defined
// with FocusConvey will be run. The rest will be ignored completely. This
// is handy when debugging a large suite that runs a misbehaving function
// repeatedly as you can disable all but one of that function
// without swaths of `SkipConvey` calls, just a targeted chain of calls
// to FocusConvey.

/////////////////////////////////// Assertions ///////////////////////////////////

// assertion is an alias for a function with a signature that the convey.So()
// method can handle. Any future or custom assertions should conform to this
// method signature. The return value should be an empty string if the assertion
// passes and a well-formed failure message if not.

// The majority of exported names in the assertions package begin with the word
// 'Should' and describe how the first argument (actual) should compare with any
// of the final (expected) arguments. How many final arguments are accepted
// depends on the particular assertion that is passed in as the assert argument.
// See the examples package for use cases and the assertions package for
// documentation on specific assertion methods.

// to So is not executed and the reporter is notified that the assertion was skipped.
