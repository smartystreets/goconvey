GoConvey makes Go testing awesome
=================================

Welcome to GoConvey, a yummy Go testing tool for gophers. Works with `go test`. Use it in the terminal or browser according your viewing pleasure.

**Features:**

- Directly integrates with `go test`
- Huge suite of regression tests
- Readable, colorized console output (understandable by any manager, IT or not)
- Fully-automatic web UI (works with native Go tests, too)
- Test code generator
- Idler script automatically runs tests in the terminal
- Immediately open problem lines in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) ([some assembly required](https://github.com/asuth/subl-handler))

Installation
------------

	$ go get github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey
	$ go install github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/web/goconvey-server


Quick start
-----------

Make a test, for example:

```go
func TestSpec(t *testing.T) {
	Convey("Given some integer with a starting value", t, func() {
		x := 1

		Convey("When the integer is incremented", func() {
			x++

			Convey("The value should be greater by one", func() {
				So(x, ShouldEqual, 2)
			})
		})
	})
}
```

### In the browser

Start up the GoConvey web server at your project's path:
    $ go install github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/web/goconvey-server
    ...
    $ $GOPATH/bin/goconvey-server

Then open your browser to:

	http://localhost:8080

There you have it. As long as GoConvey is running, test results will automatically update in your browser window. The design is responsive, so you can squish the browser real tight if you need to put it beside your code.

The browser UI supports traditional Go tests, so feel free to use it even if you're not using the GoConvey style of testing.


### In the terminal

Just do what you do best:

    $ go test

Or if you want the output to include the story:

    $ go test -v

Writing tests
-------------

You can write GoConvey tests manually or with a nice code generator.


### Code Generator

From the web UI served by GoConvey, click "Code Gen" in the top-right. Then describe your program's behavior in a natural, flowing way, for example (make sure you convert indents to tabs, as GitHub transformed them to spaces):


	TestSpec
		Subject: Integer incrementation and decrementation
			Given a starting integer value
				When incremented
					The value should be greater by one
					The value should NOT be what it used to be
				When decremented
					The value should be lesser by one
					The value should NOT be what it used to be


The skeleton of your test file will be stubbed out automatically as you type. There
are a few things to notice about this:

- Lines starting with "Test" (case-sensitive), without indentation, are treated as the name of the function in which all nested tests will be included
- Indentation defines scope
- Assertions are not made here; you'll do that later after pasting the generated code into your `_test.go` file.


### Manually

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/tree/master/examples).
We recommend reviewing [isolated_execution_test.go](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/blob/master/convey/isolated_execution_test.go) for a more thorough understanding of how tests are
composed and how they actually work.

Happy? Well, it gets even better with the auto-reload script.  This script detects changes below
the directory where it is run and recurses that location, running `go test` wherever it finds
`*_test.go` files. This means that once it's running you don't ever have to leave your editor
to run tests.  It also accepts the `-v` argument for verbose mode. Check it out:

	$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/examples
	$ $GOPATH/src/github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/scripts/idle.py

Assertions:

Thanks to [github.com/jacobsa](https://github.com/jacobsa/oglematchers) for his excellent 
[oglematchers](https://github.com/smartystreets/oglmatchers) library, which
is what many of these methods make use of to do their jobs.


Writing your own assertions:
----------------------------

Sometimes a test suite will might need an assertion that is too
specific to be included in this tool. Not to worry, simply implement
a function with the following signature (fill in the bracketed parts
and string values):

```go
func should<do-something>(actual interface, expected ...interface{}) string {
    if <some-important-condition-is-met(actual, expected)> {
        return "" // empty string means the assertion passed
    } else {
        return "some descriptive message detailing why the assertion failed..."
    }
}
```

Suppose I implemented the following assertion:

```go
func shouldScareGophersMoreThan(actual interface, expected ...interface{}) string {
    if actual == "BOO!" && expected[0] == "boo" {
        return ""
    } else {
        return "Ha! You'll have to get a lot friendlier with the capslock if you want to scare a gopher!"
    }
}
```

I can then make use of the assertion function when calling the `So(...)` method in the tests:

```go
Convey("All caps always makes text more meaningful", func() {
    So("BOO!", shouldScareGophersMoreThan, "boo")
})
```

Skipping `Convey` Registrations:
--------------------------------

Changing a `Convey` to `SkipConvey` prevents the `func()` associated with
that call from running. This also has the consequence of preventing any nested 
`Convey` registrations from running. The reporter will indicate that the 
registration was skipped.

```go
SkipConvey("Important stuff", func() { // This func() will not be executed!

    Convey("More important stuff", func() {
        So("asdf", ShouldEqual, "asdf")
    })

})
```

Using `SkipConvey` has nearly the same effect as commenting out the test
entirely. However, this is preferred over commenting out tests to avoid the
usual "declared/imported but not used" errors. Usage of `SkipConvey` is
intended for temporary code alterations.


Unimplemented `Convey` Registrations:
-------------------------------------

When composing `Convey` registrations sometimes it's convenient to use `nil`
instead of an actual `func()`. This allows you to do that and it also provides
an indication in the report that the registration is not complete.

```go
Convey("Some stuff", func() {

    // This will show up as 'skipped' in the report
    Convey("Should go boink", nil)

}
```

Skipping `So` Assertions:
-------------------------

Similar to `SkipConvey`, changing a `So` to `SkipSo` prevents the execution of
that assertion. The report will show that the assertion was skipped.

```go
Convey("1 Should Equal 2", func() {
    
    // This assertion will not be executed and will show up as 'skipped' in the report
    SkipSo(1, ShouldEqual, 2)

})
```

And like `SkipConvey`, this function is only intended for use during
temporary code alterations.
