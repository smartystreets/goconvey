- Shows test coverage (Go 1.2+)
- Readable, colorized console output (understandable by any manager, IT or not)
- Test code generator
- Desktop notifications (optional)

Installation
------------

Make sure you are running  go version 1.2 

	$ go get -t github.com/smartystreets/goconvey

The `-t` flag above ensures that all test dependencies for goconvey are downloaded.



[Quick start](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki#get-going-in-25-seconds)
-----------

Make a test, for example:

```go
func TestSpec(t *testing.T) {
	var x int
	
	// Only pass t into top-level Convey calls
	Convey("Given some integer with a starting value", t, func() {
		x = 1

		Convey("When the integer is incremented", func() {
			x++

			Convey("The value should be greater by one", func() {
				So(x, ShouldEqual, 2)
			})
		})
	})
}
```


#### [In the browser](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Web-UI)

Start up the GoConvey web server at your project's path:

	$ $GOPATH/bin/goconvey

Then open your browser to:

	http://localhost:8080

There you have it. As long as GoConvey is running, test results will automatically update in your browser window. The design is responsive, so you can squish the browser real tight if you need to put it beside your code.

The [web UI](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Web-UI) supports traditional Go tests, so use it even if you're not using GoConvey tests.



#### [In the terminal](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/wiki/Execution)

Just do what you do best:

    $ go test

Or if you want the output to include the story:

    $ go test -v
